\section{Overview}

This chapter investigates the development of a multi-modal emotion recognition system for a robot that integrates both facial expression and speech analysis to determine human emotions. The system comprises two main components: image-based emotion recognition and speech-based emotion recognition. Three face detection methods (Haar Cascades, Dlib HOG + SVM, and YOLOv4) were compared for the image-based component to identify the most effective technique for isolating faces from images. Subsequently, three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2) were evaluated for their performance in classifying emotions from the segmented facial images. The speech-based component utilises IBM Watson's speech-to-text API to transcribe and analyse user speech for emotion detection. The integration of these components allows the robot to accurately assess emotions through visual and auditory input, providing a robust and comprehensive understanding of human emotional states.

\subsection{Training Computer}

Since training efficiency is not the focus of this project, the HP Z8 G4 Workstation is its training PC, a high-performance computing solution tailored for intensive professional tasks. The system features dual Intel Xeon Gold 6244 CPUs with 8 cores and 16 threads operating at 3.60GHz, 512 GB of Samsung ECC RAM running at 2666MT/s, and two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs with 48GB of GDDR6 memory each.

The development environment was set up using Python 3.10.12 on the training PC with Ubuntu 22.04. Image processing and face detection were handled using OpenCV 4.5, the Dlib library and darknet by Alexeyab \cite{Alexey_2021-lf}. TensorFlow 2.15.1 and Keras were used to develop and train CNN models. Speech analysis was performed using the IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API. 

\section{Methods}

To implement emotion detection algorithms, we will utilise various software libraries and frameworks tailored to different aspects of the task. This section outlines the methodologies and tools that will be employed for both facial detection and emotion recognition.

\subsection{Facial Detection Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Haar Cascade}

The emotion recognition system considers the Haar Cascade model as a choice for face detection. This pretrained model is easily accessible and adept at identifying faces in images. The Haar Cascade algorithm, created by Viola and Jones \cite{Viola990517}, is a well-regarded technique for object detection, with a particular emphasis on detecting faces within images.

The Haar Cascade algorithm identifies a collection of rectangular features referred to as Haar-like features. These features are basic designs that exhibit variations in pixel intensities across adjacent sections of the image. To efficiently compute these Haar-like features, the algorithm leverages an integral image representation of the input image. The integral image enables swift computation of the total sum of pixel intensities within any given rectangular area of the image.

The following step entails instructing a series of weak classifiers with the Adaboost learning algorithm. Each of these classifiers is taught to recognise a particular Haar-like feature that is indicative of the intended object, such as a face. Throughout the training process, Adaboost allocates greater importance to incorrectly classified examples, directing subsequent iterations towards rectifying these mistakes.

The Haar Cascade classifier utilises a cascade structure to organise trained weak classifiers. Sequentially arranged, each stage of the cascade consists of multiple weak classifiers. The cascade design enables early stages to swiftly reject negative examples, while positive examples proceed to subsequent stages for further evaluation. During the detection phase, the Haar Cascade algorithm utilises a sliding window approach to scan the input image. At each position of the sliding window, the algorithm applies each stage of the cascade sequentially, rapidly discarding regions of the image that are unlikely to contain the target object based on the results of earlier stages.

After going through all the stages of the cascade, the regions of the image that meet the criteria for the target object are identified as positive detections. The algorithm provides the location and size of the detected objects in the image by producing bounding boxes around these regions.

One of the key advantages of the Haar Cascade model is its efficiency and ease of implementation. It is pre-trained on an extensive dataset of labeled face images, allowing for immediate use without the need for additional training. The training set comprises 4,916 hand-labeled faces, all scaled and aligned to a base resolution of 24x24 pixels, ensuring consistency and accuracy in detection. These faces were extracted from a diverse set of images collected through a random crawl of the World Wide Web, offering robustness across various scenarios. Additionally, the model is evaluated on the MIT+CMU test set, which includes 130 images and 507 faces, demonstrating its capability to perform well even in complex, real-world conditions. Notably, Haar Cascade is renowned for its computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-time applications, especially in resource-constrained environments where rapid face detection is crucial.

\subsubsection{YOLO}

The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model for object detection is a highly efficient and accurate approach for real-time object detection in images and videos. This model is known for its unique architecture and approach, which enable it to detect objects with remarkable accuracy. The YOLO model has gained popularity in the academic and research communities due to its exceptional performance, and it has become an important tool for various applications in computer vision and machine learning.

YOLO's heart lies its single neural network architecture that operates directly on the full image, rather than using traditional sliding window or region proposal methods. This enables YOLO to simultaneously predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects in a single forward pass through the network. This approach eliminates the need for multiple passes and significantly reduces computational overhead, making YOLO well-suited for a robotics application where available computational resources are small.

The YOLO algorithm employs a technique where the input image is partitioned into a grid of cells. Within each cell, YOLO predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in that cell. In particular, every grid cell is responsible for predicting several bounding boxes, whether or not objects exist within that cell. This approach ensures that YOLO preserves spatial information and can accurately identify objects of diverse sizes and aspect ratios.

The YOLO model applies a regression approach to anticipate bounding boxes, which are denoted by a series of coordinates for the corresponding grid cell. In addition, the model estimates the confidence score for each bounding box, which signifies the probability of an object being present in the box and the predicted box's accuracy. This score considers both the objectness probability (the probability of an object being present within the bounding box) and the precision of the box's coordinates. YOLO then forecasts class probabilities for each bounding box to recognise the occurrence of specific objects within the image. \cite{Redmon2015-eb}

YOLO has a smaller variant called Tiny-YOLO. Although they share the same underlying principles and architecture, there are notable differences between the two in terms of model size, speed, and accuracy. 

Tiny YOLO is a condensed version of YOLO that prioritises speed and efficiency. Its streamlined network architecture reduces the number of layers and parameters, resulting in a smaller model size. This makes Tiny YOLO an excellent choice for real-time applications on devices with limited computational resources. While it may sacrifice some accuracy compared to its larger counterpart, Tiny YOLO still delivers competitive performance in object detection tasks. Its balance between speed and accuracy makes it well suited for a robotics application.

\subsubsection{HOG + Linear SVM}

This consists of two components combined to make a method known for its robustness and efficiency in object detection tasks, including face detection.

The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor, it focuses on the structure or shape of an object by capturing the distribution of intensity gradients or edge directions. The first step is gradient computation, typically done using a filter, such as the Sobel operator.

The image is first divided into small spatial regions called cells, such as 8x8 pixels. A histogram of gradient directions is created for each cell, with the magnitude of each gradient used to vote into the histogram bins based on the orientation. Typically, 9 bins are used, covering 0 to 180 degrees.

Histograms are usually normalised to address differences in illumination and contrast. This normalisation involves grouping the cells into larger spatial regions called blocks, for example, 2x2 cells to a block. The histograms within a block are then concatenated to form the block descriptor. The normalisation factor is then applied and typically includes options such as L2-norm, L2-Hys, L1-norm, or L1-sqrt.

A detection window is then moved across the image at multiple scales. For each window, a HOG descriptor is calculated and used in the linear SVM.

The linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm specifically designed for binary classification tasks. In the context of face detection, the SVM is used to distinguish between face and non-face HOG descriptors. This involves training the SVM on a dataset containing labelled examples of both faces and non-faces, each represented by its corresponding HOG descriptor. During the detection process, the HOG descriptor of each detection window is computed and then entered into the trained SVM classifier. Based on the input, the SVM generates a score that indicates the likelihood of the window being a face or a non-face. Typically, windows with scores that surpass a certain threshold are classified as faces. \cite{1467360}

\subsection{Emotion Recognition Model}

After successfully detecting faces, an emotion recognition system is created using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The CNN model will be taught to categorise facial expressions into specific emotion categories, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. Using the TensorFlow framework gives a flexible and effective platform for developing, training, and implementing deep learning models. 

In summary, the methodology for emotion detection will involve testing multiple facial detection algorithms, including YOLOv4, dlib, and Haar Cascade. This will be followed by the implementation of a CNN model in TensorFlow for emotion recognition. This comprehensive approach aims to develop a robust and accurate system for real-time emotion detection from visual inputs.

Three models, VGG16, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, will be tested.

\subsubsection{MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16}

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are by far the most widely used architectures in emotion recognition research. Their ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw image data makes them highly effective for complex tasks like facial emotion detection. However, despite their popularity, many studies in the literature do not specify the exact CNN architecture used, leaving out important details about model choice and design. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to assess and compare the performance of different approaches across datasets and applications.

The three CNN architectures considered in this work—MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16—were all used to high degrees of success in the literature. Each offers different trade-offs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and computational requirements.

MobileNetV2 is a lightweight CNN that uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computations, making it highly efficient for real-time applications on devices with limited resources. Its simplicity makes it ideal for mobile and embedded systems, but this efficiency comes at the cost of potentially missing more complex emotional cues in images.

ResNet50, on the other hand, uses a much deeper network with residual learning to solve the problem of vanishing gradients, allowing it to learn more detailed and hierarchical features. This makes ResNet50 highly effective for recognising subtle facial expressions, although its deep architecture increases computational demand, making it less suitable for real-time systems without powerful hardware.

VGG16, known for its simplicity and effectiveness, uses small convolutional filters (3x3) across 16 layers. It is particularly good at capturing fine-grained visual details, but its large number of parameters makes it resource-intensive, resulting in slower processing times compared to more optimised models like MobileNetV2.

In this work, all models were trained using transfer learning, a technique where a pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned on a new dataset. Transfer learning leverages the knowledge these networks have already gained from training on large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet, to accelerate learning on smaller, domain-specific datasets. This approach significantly reduces computational resources and training time required, while still achieving high accuracy. By reusing learned features from earlier layers and adapting them to emotion recognition, transfer learning allows these models to generalise well, even when trained on limited data specific to facial emotions.
